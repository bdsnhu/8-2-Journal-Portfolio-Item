How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret the user needs and implement them into a program if I was a Product Owner by creating a Product Backlog, have a meeting with the Scrum Master to talk about what the user needs. Then, the Scrum Master would have a meeting with the Developer and the Tester to talk about what the user needs in code and test cases. Creating "user stories" helps with this by writing down what the user needs so that the Scrum Master, the Developer, and the Tester knows what the user needs.
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I would approach developing programs by asking questions, and then I would try to figure out how to develop the programs. The agile processes that I hope to incorporate into my future development work are: sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review, and sprint retrospective so that the develop is good and test passes.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
It means to be able to communicate, and collaborate with the team. Also, it means they are responible to get their job done. Also, they believe in other team members to get their job done. Also, it means they make sure that each team member delivers on their promise.
